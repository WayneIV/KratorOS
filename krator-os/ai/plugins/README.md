# Krator AI plugins

Plugins extend the assistant with custom commands. Available plugins:

- `example_plugin` – echoes any text passed to it.
- `data_sweep_plugin` – runs the `data_sweep.sh` script to gather system info.

Invoke a plugin by prefixing its name with `!` when interacting with the daemon.
